Provides sophisticated Maven support for custom `settings.xml` files which refer to a central maven mirror in the
context of a Cloudogu EcoSystem. This global variable writes custom `settings.xml` files and can additionally invoke a
provided or custom Maven call. All calls to any of the listed maven settings functions use the in nexus integrated maven
central proxy repository if no other maven central mirror is configured.

Any `settings.xml` being written will be removed once the settings body is left.

When written, the `settings.xml`'s structure will look like this:

|
+->settings
|   +-> localRepository
|   `-> servers
|        `-> server
|             +-> id (generated with FQDN)
|             +-> username (taken from credentials)
|             `-> password (taken from credentials)
|
`-> mirrors
     `-> mirror
          +-> id (reference to the server id)
          +-> name (generated from FQDN)
          +-> url (generated from FQDN)
          +-> mirrorOf (fix value of central maven mirror)

Example call:

nexusCreds = usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'jenkinsNexusServiceUser', passwordVariable: 'PASSWORD', usernameVariable: 'USERNAME')
withMavenSettings.mvnWithSettings(nexusCreds, 'cesinstance.stage.host.tld', '/usr/share/maven') { settingsXml ->
    // do something with the settings.xml here
} // settings.xml will be removed automatically

Example call with included Maven call:

withMavenSettings.mvnWithSettings(nexusCreds, 'cesinstance.stage.host.tld', 'yourMavenGoal')

- settings(def nexusCredentials, String cesFQDN, String pathToLocalMavenRepository, Closure closure)
  -  Writes a `settings.xml` file with the given Nexus credentials and executes the closure body.
     This method provides a parameter `settingsXml` which contains the relative file path to the 'settings.xml' file.

- mvn(String settingsXml, String mvnCallArgs)
  - call the Jenkins Tool Maven with a provided `settings.xml`

- mvnWithSettings(def nexusCredentials, String cesFQDN, String mvnCallArgs)
- mvnWithSettings(def nexusCredentials, String cesFQDN, String customMirror, String mvnCallArgs)
  - call Jenkins Tool Maven wrapped within a settings file. This is basically a convenience mix of `settings` and `mvn`

- customMvnWithSettings(def nexusCredentials, String cesFQDN, String mvnHome, String pathToLocalMavenRepository, String mvnCallArgs)
- customMvnWithSettings(def nexusCredentials, String cesFQDN, String mvnHome, String pathToLocalMavenRepository, String customMirror, String mvnCallArgs)
  - similar to `mvnWithSettings` but calls a custom Maven installation instead. It is necessary to know about the location of
  the Maven installation. Calling this method can make sense if the Maven installation resides in a Docker container.
